            <p class="HomeP">Since I began my college exspericance I have become afluant in web design and development. 
            As to date I have build over 10+ websites from the ground up, have mastered the process of hosting and running a serveer, have become astute in knowledge of My SQL and databases, and have come to understand Java. 
            And while I am very happy with what I have learned so far, I also look forward to what is to come and all the other things I have yet to learn.</p>
